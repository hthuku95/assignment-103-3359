I cannot generate raw executable code for a PNG image file. PNG files are binary image formats that contain compressed pixel data, not text-based code.

For the note-taking application icon at `src/main/resources/icons/note.png`, you would need:

1. An actual PNG image file created using image editing software (like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools)
2. The image should be appropriately sized (typically 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels for application icons)
3. The image should visually represent a note or notepad

Since this is a binary file format, I cannot provide "raw executable code" for it. You would need to either:
- Create the icon using image editing software
- Download a suitable note icon from icon libraries
- Use a placeholder icon temporarily

Would you like me to help with other code files for your note-taking application instead?
